  - Backup and Restore
    - [Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/backup-and-restore-overview.md): TiDB Backup & Restore (BR) ensures high availability of clusters and data safety. It supports disaster recovery with a short RPO, handles misoperations, and provides history data auditing. It is recommended to perform backup operations during off-peak hours and store backup data to compatible storage systems. BR supports full backup and log backup, as well as restoring data to any point in time. It is important to use BR of the same major version as the TiDB cluster for backup and restoration.
    - Architecture
      - [Architecture Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/backup-and-restore-design.md): TiDB supports backup and restore for cluster data using Backup & Restore (BR) and TiDB Operator. Tasks can be created to back up data from TiKV nodes and restore data to TiKV nodes. The architecture includes full data backup and restore, data change log backup, and point-in-time recovery (PITR). For details, refer to specific documents for each feature.
      - [Snapshot Backup and Restore Architecture](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/br-snapshot-architecture.md): TiDB Snapshot Backup and Restore Architecture introduces the process using a Backup & Restore (BR) tool. The architecture includes backup and restore processes, types of backup files, naming format, storage format, and structure of backup files. The backup process involves scheduling, data backup, and metadata backup. The restore process includes scheduling, schema restore, Region allocation, data restore, and reporting. The types of backup files include SST, backupmeta, and backup.lock files. The naming format and storage format of SST files are explained in detail. For more information, refer to the TiDB snapshot backup and restore guide.

To use point-in-time recovery (PITR), deploy a TiDB cluster >= v6.2.0 and update BR to the same version as the TiDB cluster. Configure backup storage on Amazon S3 and set a backup policy to meet data loss and recovery requirements. Run log and snapshot backups, and use PITR to restore data to a specific time point. Clean up outdated data regularly. For detailed steps, refer to TiDB documentation.
      - [Backup Storages](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/backup-and-restore-storages.md): TiDB supports backup storage to Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, and NFS. You can specify the URI and authentication for different storage services. BR sends credentials to TiKV by default when using S3, GCS, or Azure Blob Storage. You can disable this for cloud environments. The URI format for each storage service is specified, along with authentication methods. Server-side encryption is supported for Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage. BR v6.3.0 also supports AWS S3 Object Lock.
    - BR CLI Manuals
      - [Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/use-br-command-line-tool.md): The `br` command-line tool is used for snapshot backup, log backup, and point-in-time recovery (PITR) in TiDB clusters. It consists of sub-commands, options, and parameters, with common options like `--pd` for PD service address and `-s` for storage path. Sub-commands include `tiup br backup`, `tiup br log`, and `tiup br restore`, each with specific functionalities. Backup commands include `full`, `db`, and `table` options, while log backup and restore commands have various tasks for managing backup operations.
      - [Snapshot Backup and Restore Command Manual](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/br-snapshot-manual.md): TiDB Snapshot Backup and Restore Command Manual describes commands for backing up and restoring cluster snapshots, databases, and tables. It also covers encrypting backup data and restoring encrypted snapshots. The BR tool supports self-adapting to GC and introduces the --ignore-stats parameter for backing up and restoring statistics. It also supports encrypting backup data and restoring partial data of specified databases or tables.
      - [Log Backup and PITR Command Manual](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/br-pitr-manual.md): Introduce the commands used in TiDB log backup and point-in-time recovery (PITR).
    - References
      - BR Features
        - [Backup Auto-Tune](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/br-auto-tune.md): TiDB v5.4.0 introduces the auto-tune feature for backup tasks, which is enabled by default. It limits the resources used by backup tasks to reduce their impact on the cluster. You can enable or disable the feature dynamically without restarting the cluster. However, auto-tune may not completely remove the impact of backup on the cluster due to limitations. Adjusting the number of threads used by backup tasks can help mitigate the impact in certain scenarios.
        - [Batch Create Table](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/br-batch-create-table.md): TiDB v6.0.0 introduces the Batch Create Table feature to speed up the table creation process during data restoration. It is enabled by default and creates tables in batches, significantly reducing the time for restoring data with a large number of tables. The feature test shows that the average speed of restoring one TiKV instance is as high as 181.65 MB/s.
        - [Checkpoint Backup](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/br-checkpoint-backup.md): TiDB v6.5.0 introduces checkpoint backup feature to continue interrupted backups, reducing the need to start from scratch. It records backed up shards to resume backup progress, but relies on GC mechanism and may require some data to be backed up again. The `br` tool periodically updates `gc-safepoint` to avoid data being garbage collected, and can extend retention period if needed.
        - [Checkpoint Restore](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/br-checkpoint-restore.md): TiDB v7.1.0 introduces checkpoint restore, allowing interrupted snapshot and log restores to continue without starting from scratch. It records restored shards and table IDs, enabling retries to use the progress point close to the interruption. However, it relies on the GC mechanism and may require some data to be restored again. It's important to avoid modifying cluster data during the restore to ensure accuracy.

      - [Back Up and Restore RawKV](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/rawkv-backup-and-restore.md): TiKV and PD can form a KV database known as RawKV without TiDB. TiKV-BR supports data backup and restore for RawKV. For more details, visit the TiKV-BR User Docs on the TiKV website.
      - [Incremental Backup and Restore](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/br-incremental-guide.md): Incremental data is the differentiated data between starting and end snapshots, along with DDLs. It reduces backup volume and requires setting `tidb_gc_life_time` for incremental backup. Use `tiup br backup` with `--lastbackupts` for incremental backup and ensure all previous data is restored before restoring incremental data.

  - PingCAP Clinic Diagnostic Service
    - [Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/clinic-introduction.md): PingCAP Clinic is a diagnostic service for TiDB clusters deployed using TiUP or TiDB Operator. It helps troubleshoot cluster problems remotely, ensures stable operation, and provides quick cluster status checks. The service includes Diag client for data collection and Clinic Server for online diagnostic reports. Users can troubleshoot problems remotely and quickly check cluster status. Diag collects diagnostic data through various methods, and Clinic Server has limitations on clusters, storage, and data size. The service is free until April 15, 2025. Next steps include using PingCAP Clinic in different environments.
    - [Quick Start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/quick-start-with-clinic.md): PingCAP Clinic is a service for collecting and viewing cluster diagnosis data quickly. It consists of Diag client and Clinic Server. Users can collect diagnostic data with Diag, upload it to Clinic Server, and view the results of Health Report. Before using it, users need to install Diag, log in to Clinic Server, create an organization, get an access token, and set the token and region in Diag. After collecting and uploading data, users can get the data access link and view the Health Report.
    - [Troubleshoot Clusters Using PingCAP Clinic](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/clinic-user-guide-for-tiup.md): PingCAP Clinic Diagnostic Service (PingCAP Clinic) helps troubleshoot TiDB and DM clusters deployed using TiUP.
