    - [Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/backup-and-restore-overview.md): TiDB Backup & Restore (BR) ensures high availability of clusters and data safety. It supports disaster recovery with a short RPO, handles misoperations, and provides history data auditing. It is recommended to perform backup operations during off-peak hours and store backup data to compatible storage systems. BR supports full backup and log backup, as well as restoring data to any point in time. It is important to use BR of the same major version as the TiDB cluster for backup and restoration.
    - Architecture
      - [Architecture Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/backup-and-restore-design.md): TiDB supports backup and restore for cluster data using Backup & Restore (BR) and TiDB Operator. Tasks can be created to back up data from TiKV nodes and restore data to TiKV nodes. The architecture includes full data backup and restore, data change log backup, and point-in-time recovery (PITR). For details, refer to specific documents for each feature.

      - [Use Cases](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/backup-and-restore-use-cases.md): TiDB provides snapshot and log backup solutions for specific use cases, such as timely data recovery and business audits. To use point-in-time recovery (PITR), deploy a TiDB cluster >= v6.2.0 and update BR to the same version as the TiDB cluster. Configure backup storage on Amazon S3 and set a backup policy to meet data loss and recovery requirements. Run log and snapshot backups, and use PITR to restore data to a specific time point. Clean up outdated data regularly. For detailed steps, refer to TiDB documentation.
      - [Backup Storages](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/backup-and-restore-storages.md): TiDB supports backup storage to Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, and NFS.

    - References
      - BR Features
        - [Backup Auto-Tune](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/br-auto-tune.md): TiDB v5.4.0 introduces the auto-tune feature for backup tasks, which is enabled by default. It limits the resources used by backup tasks to reduce their impact on the cluster. You can enable or disable the feature dynamically without restarting the cluster. However, auto-tune may not completely remove the impact of backup on the cluster due to limitations. Adjusting the number of threads used by backup tasks can help mitigate the impact in certain scenarios.
        - [Batch Create Table](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/br-batch-create-table.md): TiDB v6.0.0 introduces the Batch Create Table feature to speed up the table creation process during data restoration. It is enabled by default and creates tables in batches, significantly reducing the time for restoring data with a large number of tables. The feature test shows that the average speed of restoring one TiKV instance is as high as 181.65 MB/s.
        - [Checkpoint Backup](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/br-checkpoint-backup.md): TiDB v6.5.0 introduces checkpoint backup feature to continue interrupted backups, reducing the need to start from scratch. It records backed up shards to resume backup progress, but relies on GC mechanism and may require some data to be backed up again. The `br` tool periodically updates `gc-safepoint` to avoid data being garbage collected, and can extend retention period if needed.
        - [Checkpoint Restore](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/br-checkpoint-restore.md): TiDB v7.1.0 introduces checkpoint restore, allowing interrupted snapshot and log restores to continue without starting from scratch. It records restored shards and table IDs, enabling retries to use the progress point close to the interruption. However, it relies on the GC mechanism and may require some data to be restored again. It's important to avoid modifying cluster data during the restore to ensure accuracy.

      - [User Management](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dashboard-user.md): TiDB Dashboard uses the same user privilege system as TiDB. SQL users need specific privileges to access the dashboard, including PROCESS, SHOW DATABASES, CONFIG, DASHBOARD_CLIENT, and more. It's recommended to create users with only the required privileges to prevent unintended operations. Users with high privileges can also sign in. To create a least-privileged SQL user, grant the necessary privileges and use role-based access control (RBAC) if needed.
      - [Secure](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dashboard-ops-security.md): TiDB Dashboard requires enhanced security measures, including setting a strong password for the root user, creating a least-privileged user, and using a firewall to block untrusted access.

  - [Local Reads in Three-Data-Center Deployments](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/three-dc-local-read.md): TiDB's three data center deployment model can cause increased access latency due to cross-center data reads. To mitigate this, the Stale Read feature allows for local historical data access, reducing latency at the expense of real-time data availability. When using Stale Read in geo-distributed scenarios, TiDB accesses local replicas to avoid cross-center network latency. This is achieved by configuring the `zone` label and setting `tidb_replica_read` to `closest-replicas`. For more information on performing Stale Read, refer to the documentation.
