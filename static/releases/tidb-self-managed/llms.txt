PD supports gRPC, disaster recovery toolkit, and hot Region scheduling. TiKV supports gRPC, SST format snapshot, memory leak detection, and improved data importing speed. Overall, the release enhances performance, stability, and management capabilities.
    - [RC2](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/release-rc.2.md): TiDB RC2, released on March 1, 2017, focuses on MySQL compatibility, SQL query optimization, system stability, and performance. It introduces a new permission management mechanism, allowing users to control data access similar to MySQL privilege management. Key improvements include query optimizer enhancements, basic privilege management support, MySQL built-in functions, and performance optimizations. PD now supports location aware replica scheduling and fast scheduling based on region count, while TiKV introduces Async Apply for improved write performance and various optimizations for read and insert performance. Bug fixes and memory leak solutions are also included.
    - [RC1](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/release-rc.1.md): TiDB RC1 was released on December 23, 2016. Updates include improved write speed and reduced disk space usage in TiKV, optimized scheduling strategy framework in PD, and added features in the SQL query optimizer and new tools in TiDB. The release also supports more built-in functions in MySQL and enhances the speed of the `add index` statement.
